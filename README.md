# LinkedIn Network Analysis

## Motivation
As an active user on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardcsuwandi/) with more than 1000 connections, I was curious about the statistics of my network. 
In this project, I utilized exploratory analysis and data visualizations to gain insights from my own LinkedIn data.

The notebook of this project can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/richardcsuwandi/linkedin-network-analysis/blob/master/linkedin-network-analysis.ipynb)

## Key Findings

### Number of Connections on a Given Date

From the line plot above, we can see that there is a peak in the number of connections per day on 26 August 2020. It also seems that August 2020 is the period when I was the most active on LinkedIn.

### Top Companies/Organizations in my Network

![Company Treemap](https://github.com/richardcsuwandi/linkedin-network-analysis/blob/master/images/company_treemap.png?raw=true)
Using the treemap above, it is easier to compare the proportion of one company/organization to the others. It looks like the largest proportion of my network are from my university.

### Top Positions in my Network

Wow! I didn't expect to see that many data scientists in my network, followed by machine learning engineers and data analysts. It is great to know that the top common positions in my network are my target group for networking.
